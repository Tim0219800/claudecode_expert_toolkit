# Explain Code

If a file path is provided, read that file.
Otherwise, ask which file or code to analyze.

Provide a clear, structured explanation:

1. **Overview** - General purpose of the code
2. **Architecture** - Structure and organization
3. **Main Functions** - Role of each function/class
4. **Data Flow** - How data moves through the code
5. **Dependencies** - Libraries and imports used
6. **Points of Attention** - Complexity, potential bugs, possible improvements

Use simple language and analogies when helpful.
